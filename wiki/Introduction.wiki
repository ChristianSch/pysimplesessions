#summary Introduction to the system

= Introduction =

This project is intended to provide an implementation of the PHP sessions.

= Details =

The sessions are implemented like the PHP sessions. At least partly.

==Server-side==
All sessions are managed in a directory of choice. (Default: `.sessions/`)
Every session is handled as a file with its ID as name.

Since the session-class works like a dictionary, all keys are stored in the sessions file on exit.

==Client-side==
Exactly like the PHP sessions, the `session_id` is stored in a cookie.

=Example Usage=
Here is a small example usage for the pySimpleSessions.

{{{#!/usr/bin/python

import sessions

# initiate new Session
session = sessions.Session()

# if session has the attribute count, iterate it
try:
    # do not forget typecasting! int(bla)
    # otherwise you cannot iterate the count
    session["count"] = int(session["count"]) + 1
# else set count
except:
    session["count"] = 1

print "You visited us " + str(session["count"]) + " times."}}}
