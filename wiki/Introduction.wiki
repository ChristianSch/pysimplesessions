#summary Introduction to the system

= Introduction =

This project is intended to provide an implementation of the PHP sessions.

= Details =

The sessions are implemented like the PHP sessions. At least partly.

==Server-side==
All sessions are managed in a directory of choice. (Default: `.sessions/`)
Every session is handled as a file with its ID as name.

Since the session-class works like a dictionary, all keys are stored in the sessions file on exit.

==Client-side==
Exactly like the PHP sessions, the `session_id` is stored in a cookie.

=Example Usage=
Here is a small example usage for the pySimpleSessions.
